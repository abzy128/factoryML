We extend our deepest gratitude to our supervisor, Anar Rakhimzhanova, whose guidance and expertise were instrumental in shaping this research. Her consistent support and technical insights helped us navigate complex challenges and maintain focus on practical outcomes. We also thank "Business \& Technology Services" LLP, particularly their industrial analytics team, for sharing their extensive knowledge of manufacturing operations and sensor data collection practices. Their real-world perspective ensured our solution addressed actual industry needs rather than theoretical problems.
