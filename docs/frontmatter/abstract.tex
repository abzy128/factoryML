Unplanned downtime in industrial equipment remains a significant challenge for manufacturing facilities. While many predictive maintenance solutions exist, they are often proprietary, costly, and lack transparency, hindering widespread adoption and trust. This research details the development of an open-source predictive maintenance system designed to be both effective and accessible. We utilized a machine learning approach, focusing on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict equipment behavior based on sensor data. Our methodology encompassed data pre-processing, model comparison, and the creation of a sequential Keras LSTM model. To support this, we developed a comprehensive architecture including a digital twin for data simulation, a FastAPI-based inference service, a data gateway with TimescaleDB for efficient storage and caching, and a React/Next.js frontend for visualization. The system successfully predicts equipment sensor values, allowing for the early detection of anomalies and deviations. This enables manufacturers to implement preventative maintenance strategies, prolong equipment life, and reduce reliance on closed-source solutions, thereby avoiding vendor lock-in. The developed models and surrounding architecture provide a ready-to-use, easily configurable solution for industrial applications.
