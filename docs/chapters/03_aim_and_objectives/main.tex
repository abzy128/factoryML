\section{Aim}
To devise a model that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze data acquired from sensors in industrial environments, with the aim of identifying anomalies and predicting potential equipment failures.


\section{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze common issues and inefficiencies in the manufacturing process that are caused by current equipment monitoring systems.
    \item Gather and preprocess data from sensors within manufacturing equipment.
    \item Research and select suitable machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis purposes.
    \item Develop and train a machine learning model that can detect anomalies and predict failures.
    \item Validate the model's performance using real or simulated sensor data.
    \item Develop a framework that is ready for deployment in manufacturing environments.
\end{itemize}

\section{Significance of Study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The proposed model will enable manufacturing facilities to transition from
reactive to predictive maintenance.
    \item It can reduce downtime, optimize resource allocation, and extend equipment
life, leading to cost savings and increased operational efficiency.
    \item The setup time and labor costs of the current system can be reduced, optimizing
the deployment process.
\end{itemize}
