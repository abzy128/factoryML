\subsection{Aim}
To develop a model that uses machine learning to analyze data from equipment
sensors in manufacturing facilities, enabling anomaly detection and downtime
prediction.

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze common issues and inefficiencies in manufacturing caused by current equipment monitoring systems.
    \item Gather and preprocess sensor data from manufacturing equipment.
    \item Research and select appropriate machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
    \item Design and train a machine learning model capable of detecting anomalies and predicting failures.
    \item Validate the modelâ€™s performance using real or simulated sensor data.
    \item Create a deployment-ready framework for use in manufacturing environments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Significance of Study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The proposed model will enable manufacturing facilities to transition from
reactive to predictive maintenance.
    \item It can reduce downtime, optimize resource allocation, and extend equipment
life, leading to cost savings and increased operational efficiency.
    \item The setup time and labor costs of the current system can be reduced, optimizing
the deployment process.
\end{itemize}
