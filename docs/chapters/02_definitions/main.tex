\paragraph{Python} Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language widely used for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing due to its simplicity and extensive ecosystem of libraries.

\paragraph{CUDA} Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It allows developers to utilize GPU acceleration for deep learning, numerical simulations, and large-scale computations.

\paragraph{Linux} Linux is an open-source operating system kernel known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is widely used in server environments, high-performance computing, and embedded systems.

\paragraph{Jupyter} Jupyter is an application that allows to write Python code alongside Markdown documentations. It works with Python environments out of the box and decreases complexity of the code base.

\paragraph{TensorFlow} TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides tools for building and deploying deep learning models efficiently, supporting both CPU and GPU acceleration.

\paragraph{Keras} Keras is a high-level deep learning API that runs on top of TensorFlow. It simplifies the process of building and training neural networks by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

\paragraph{Matplotlib} Matplotlib is a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It is commonly used for plotting data in scientific computing and machine learning.

\paragraph{Scikit-learn} Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library for machine learning. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

\paragraph{Pandas} Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It offers powerful data structures like DataFrames and Series, facilitating efficient data handling and preprocessing.

\paragraph{NumPy} NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.
