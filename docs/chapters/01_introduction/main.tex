The advent of Industry 4.0 heralds a transformative era in manufacturing, characterized by the integration of digital technologies, IoT, and data-driven decision-making. As manufacturing facilities evolve, they increasingly rely on IoT sensors to monitor equipment and optimize operational processes. This shift underscores the need for advanced machine learning models that are not only effective but also open source and transparent.

Current proprietary solutions often limit flexibility and raise concerns regarding data privacy and on-premise deployment. In contrast, an open source approach ensures that the underlying algorithms and methodologies are accessible and auditable, fostering trust and enabling customization to meet specific industrial requirements. This research aims to develop a transparent machine learning model that harnesses sensor data from manufacturing facilities, thereby aligning with the core principles of Industry 4.0 and paving the way for smarter, more secure, and efficient manufacturing environments.
