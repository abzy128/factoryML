The dataset utilized in this study originates from a ferrous alloy smelting facility in Kazakhstan, which has chosen to remain anonymous to protect its proprietary information. Data from equipment sensors was collected using AVEVA Historian, a robust system designed for industrial data acquisition. Subsequently, SQL Server was employed to query and export the sensor data, resulting in a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.
